## 1. Introduction to Deep Crawling

*   1.1. Purpose: The `deep_crawling` component provides functionalities for recursively crawling web pages starting from an initial URL. It includes strategies for different traversal orders (BFS, DFS, Best-First), mechanisms for filtering which URLs to visit, and methods for scoring URLs to prioritize crawling.
*   1.2. Core Concepts:
    *   1.2.1. Definition of Deep Crawling in Crawl4ai context: The process of discovering and fetching multiple web pages by following links from an initial set of URLs, adhering to specified depth, page limits, and filtering/scoring rules.
    *   1.2.2. Key Abstractions:
        *   `DeepCrawlStrategy`: Defines the algorithm for traversing linked web pages (e.g., BFS, DFS).
        *   `URLFilter`: Determines whether a discovered URL should be considered for crawling.
        *   `URLScorer`: Assigns a score to URLs to influence crawling priority, especially in strategies like Best-First.

## 2. `DeepCrawlStrategy` Interface and Implementations

*   **2.1. `DeepCrawlStrategy` (Abstract Base Class)**
    *   Source: `crawl4ai/deep_crawling/base_strategy.py`
    *   2.1.1. Purpose: Defines the abstract base class for all deep crawling strategies, outlining the core methods required for traversal logic, resource management, URL validation, and link discovery.
    *   2.1.2. Key Abstract Methods:
        *   `async def _arun_batch(self, start_url: str, crawler: AsyncWebCrawler, config: CrawlerRunConfig) -> List[CrawlResult]`:
            *   Description: Core logic for batch (non-streaming) deep crawling. Processes URLs level by level (or according to strategy) and returns all results once the crawl is complete or limits are met.
        *   `async def _arun_stream(self, start_url: str, crawler: AsyncWebCrawler, config: CrawlerRunConfig) -> AsyncGenerator[CrawlResult, None]`:
            *   Description: Core logic for streaming deep crawling. Processes URLs and yields `CrawlResult` objects as they become available.
        *   `async def shutdown(self) -> None`:
            *   Description: Cleans up any resources used by the deep crawl strategy, such as signaling cancellation events.
        *   `async def can_process_url(self, url: str, depth: int) -> bool`:
            *   Description: Validates a given URL and current depth against configured filters and limits to decide if it should be processed.
        *   `async def link_discovery(self, result: CrawlResult, source_url: str, current_depth: int, visited: Set[str], next_level: List[tuple], depths: Dict[str, int]) -> None`:
            *   Description: Extracts links from a `CrawlResult`, validates them using `can_process_url`, optionally scores them, and appends valid URLs (and their parent references) to the `next_level` list. Updates the `depths` dictionary for newly discovered URLs.
    *   2.1.3. Key Concrete Methods:
        *   `async def arun(self, start_url: str, crawler: AsyncWebCrawler, config: Optional[CrawlerRunConfig] = None) -> RunManyReturn`:
            *   Description: Main entry point for initiating a deep crawl. It checks if a `CrawlerRunConfig` is provided and then delegates to either `_arun_stream` or `_arun_batch` based on the `config.stream` flag.
        *   `def __call__(self, start_url: str, crawler: AsyncWebCrawler, config: CrawlerRunConfig)`:
            *   Description: Makes the strategy instance callable, directly invoking the `arun` method.
    *   2.1.4. Attributes:
        *   `_cancel_event (asyncio.Event)`: Event to signal cancellation of the crawl.
        *   `_pages_crawled (int)`: Counter for the number of pages successfully crawled.

    *   Source: `crawl4ai/deep_crawling/bfs_strategy.py`
    *   2.2.1. Purpose: Implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) deep crawling strategy, exploring all URLs at the current depth level before moving to the next.
    *   2.2.2. Inheritance: `DeepCrawlStrategy`
    *   2.2.3. Initialization (`__init__`)
        *   2.2.3.1. Signature:
            ```python
            def __init__(
                self,
                max_depth: int,
                filter_chain: FilterChain = FilterChain(),
                url_scorer: Optional[URLScorer] = None,
                include_external: bool = False,
                score_threshold: float = -float('inf'),
                max_pages: int = float('inf'),
                logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None,
            ):
            ```
        *   2.2.3.2. Parameters:
            *   `max_depth (int)`: Maximum depth to crawl relative to the `start_url`.
            *   `filter_chain (FilterChain`, default: `FilterChain()`)`: A `FilterChain` instance to apply to discovered URLs.
            *   `url_scorer (Optional[URLScorer]`, default: `None`)`: An optional `URLScorer` to score URLs. If provided, URLs below `score_threshold` are skipped, and for crawls exceeding `max_pages`, higher-scored URLs are prioritized.
            *   `include_external (bool`, default: `False`)`: If `True`, allows crawling of URLs from external domains.
            *   `score_threshold (float`, default: `-float('inf')`)`: Minimum score (if `url_scorer` is used) for a URL to be processed.
            *   `max_pages (int`, default: `float('inf')`)`: Maximum total number of pages to crawl.
            *   `logger (Optional[logging.Logger]`, default: `None`)`: An optional logger instance. If `None`, a default logger is created.
    *   2.2.4. Key Implemented Methods:
        *   `_arun_batch(...)`: Implements BFS traversal by processing URLs level by level. It collects all results from a level before discovering links for the next level. All results are returned as a list upon completion.
        *   `_arun_stream(...)`: Implements BFS traversal, yielding `CrawlResult` objects as soon as they are processed within a level. Link discovery for the next level happens after all URLs in the current level are processed and their results yielded.
        *   `can_process_url(...)`: Validates URL format, applies the `filter_chain`, and checks depth limits. For the start URL (depth 0), filtering is bypassed.
        *   `link_discovery(...)`: Extracts internal (and optionally external) links, normalizes them, checks against `visited` set and `can_process_url`. If a `url_scorer` is present and `max_pages` limit is a concern, it scores and sorts valid links, selecting the top ones within `remaining_capacity`.
        *   `shutdown(...)`: Sets an internal `_cancel_event` to signal graceful termination and records the end time in `stats`.
    *   2.2.5. Key Attributes/Properties:

    *   2.3.2. Inheritance: `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy` (Note: Leverages much of the `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`'s infrastructure but overrides traversal logic to use a stack.)
    *   2.3.3. Initialization (`__init__`)
        *   2.3.3.1. Signature: (Same as `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`)
            ```python

            ):
            ```
        *   2.3.3.2. Parameters: Same as `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`.
    *   2.3.4. Key Overridden/Implemented Methods:
        *   `_arun_batch(...)`: Implements DFS traversal using a LIFO stack. Processes one URL at a time, discovers its links, and adds them to the stack (typically in reverse order of discovery to maintain a natural DFS path). Collects all results in a list.
        *   `_arun_stream(...)`: Implements DFS traversal using a LIFO stack, yielding `CrawlResult` for each processed URL as it becomes available. Discovered links are added to the stack for subsequent processing.

            *   `max_depth (int)`: Maximum depth to crawl.
            *   `filter_chain (FilterChain`, default: `FilterChain()`)`: Chain of filters to apply.
            *   `url_scorer (Optional[URLScorer]`, default: `None`)`: Scorer to rank URLs. Crucial for this strategy; if not provided, URLs might effectively be processed in FIFO order (score 0).

        *   `_arun_best_first(...)`: Core logic for best-first traversal. Uses an `asyncio.PriorityQueue` where items are `(score, depth, url, parent_url)`. URLs are processed in batches (default size 10) from the priority queue. Discovered links are scored and added to the queue.
    *   2.4.5. Key Attributes/Properties:
        *   `stats (TraversalStats)`: [Read-only] - Traversal statistics object.

*   **3.2. `FilterChain`**
    *   Source: `crawl4ai/deep_crawling/filters.py`
    *   3.2.1. Purpose: Manages a sequence of `URLFilter` instances. A URL must pass all filters in the chain to be considered valid.
    *   3.2.2. Initialization (`__init__`)
        *   3.2.2.1. Signature:
            ```python

        *   `stats (FilterStats)`: [Read-only] - An instance of `FilterStats` tracking the aggregated statistics for the entire chain (total URLs processed, passed, and rejected by the chain as a whole).

*   **3.3. `URLPatternFilter`**
    *   Source: `crawl4ai/deep_crawling/filters.py`
    *   3.3.1. Purpose: Filters URLs based on whether they match a list of specified string patterns. Supports glob-style wildcards and regular expressions.
    *   3.3.2. Inheritance: `URLFilter`
    *   3.3.3. Initialization (`__init__`)
        *   3.3.3.1. Signature:
            ```python

                self,
                patterns: Union[str, Pattern, List[Union[str, Pattern]]],
                use_glob: bool = True, # Deprecated, glob is always used for strings if not regex

            ):
            ```
        *   3.3.3.2. Parameters:
            *   `patterns (Union[str, Pattern, List[Union[str, Pattern]]])`: A single pattern string/compiled regex, or a list of such patterns. String patterns are treated as glob patterns by default unless they are identifiable as regex (e.g., start with `^`, end with `$`, contain `\d`).
            *   `use_glob (bool`, default: `True`)`: [Deprecated] This parameter's functionality is now implicitly handled by pattern detection.
            *   `reverse (bool`, default: `False`)`: If `True`, the filter rejects URLs that match any of the patterns. If `False` (default), it accepts URLs that match any pattern and rejects those that don't match any.
    *   3.3.4. Key Implemented Methods:
        *   `apply(self, url: str) -> bool`:
            *   Description: Checks if the URL matches any of the configured patterns. Simple suffix/prefix/domain patterns are checked first for performance. For more complex patterns, it uses `fnmatch.translate` (for glob-like strings) or compiled regex objects. The outcome is affected by the `reverse` flag.
    *   3.3.5. Internal Categorization:
        *   `PATTERN_TYPES`: A dictionary mapping pattern types (SUFFIX, PREFIX, DOMAIN, PATH, REGEX) to integer constants.
        *   `_simple_suffixes (Set[str])`: Stores simple suffix patterns (e.g., `.html`).

                check_extension: bool = True,
                ext_map: Dict[str, str] = _MIME_MAP, # _MIME_MAP is internal
            ):

            *   `allowed_types (Union[str, List[str]])`: A single MIME type string (e.g., "text/html") or a list of allowed MIME types. Can also be partial types like "image/" to allow all image types.
            *   `check_extension (bool`, default: `True`)`: If `True` (default), the filter attempts to determine the content type by looking at the URL's file extension. If `False`, all URLs pass this filter (unless `allowed_types` is empty).

If `check_extension` is `True` and an extension is found, it checks if the inferred MIME type (or the extension itself if MIME type is unknown) is among the `allowed_types`. If no extension is found, it typically allows the URL (assuming it might be an HTML page or similar).
    *   3.4.5. Static Methods:
        *   `_extract_extension(url: str) -> str`: [Cached] Extracts the file extension from a URL path, handling query parameters and fragments.

Then, if `_allowed_domains` is specified, checks if the domain is in that list (accepts if true). If `_allowed_domains` is not specified and the URL was not blocked, it passes.
    *   3.5.5. Static Methods:
        *   `_normalize_domains(domains: Union[str, List[str]]) -> Set[str]`: Converts input domains to a set of lowercase strings.
        *   `_is_subdomain(domain: str, parent_domain: str) -> bool`: Checks if `domain` is a subdomain of (or equal to) `parent_domain`.
        *   `_extract_domain(url: str) -> str`: [Cached] Extracts the domain name from a URL.

        *   `_calculate_score(self, url: str) -> float`:
            *   Description: Uses a regex to find year patterns (YYYY) in the URL. If multiple years are found, it uses the latest valid year. The score is higher for years closer to `current_year`, using a predefined lookup for small differences or a decay function for larger differences. If no year is found, a default score (0.5) is returned.
    *   4.5.5. Helper Methods:
        *   `_extract_year(self, url: str) -> Optional[int]`: [Cached] Extracts the most recent valid year from the URL.

*   5.2. Initialization (`__init__`)
    *   5.2.1. Signature:
        ```python
        def __init__(self, crawler: AsyncWebCrawler):
        ```
    *   5.2.2. Parameters:
        *   `crawler (AsyncWebCrawler)`: The `AsyncWebCrawler` instance whose `arun` method is to be decorated.

        @wraps(original_arun)
        async def wrapped_arun(url: str, config: CrawlerRunConfig = None, **kwargs):
        ```
    *   5.3.2. Functionality: This method wraps the original `arun` method of the `AsyncWebCrawler`.
        *   It checks if `config` is provided, has a `deep_crawl_strategy` set, and if `DeepCrawlDecorator.deep_crawl_active` context variable is `False` (to prevent recursion).
        *   If these conditions are met:
            *   It sets `DeepCrawlDecorator.deep_crawl_active` to `True`.
            *   It calls the `arun` method of the specified `config.deep_crawl_strategy`.
            *   It handles potential streaming results from the strategy by wrapping them in an async generator.
            *   Finally, it resets `DeepCrawlDecorator.deep_crawl_active` to `False`.
        *   If the conditions are not met, it calls the original `arun` method of the crawler.
*   5.4. Class Variable:
    *   `deep_crawl_active (ContextVar)`:
        *   Purpose: A `contextvars.ContextVar` used as a flag to indicate if a deep crawl is currently in progress for the current asynchronous context. This prevents the decorator from re-triggering deep crawling if the strategy itself calls the crawler's `arun` or `arun_many` methods.
        *   Default Value: `False`.

## 6. `TraversalStats` Data Model

*   Source: `crawl4ai/models.py`

    *   `urls_skipped (int)`: The total number of URLs that were skipped (e.g., due to filters, already visited, or depth limits). Default: `0`.
    *   `total_depth_reached (int)`: The maximum depth reached from the start URL during the crawl. Default: `0`.
    *   `current_depth (int)`: The current depth level being processed by the crawler (can fluctuate during the crawl, especially for BFS). Default: `0`.

## 7. Configuration for Deep Crawling (`CrawlerRunConfig`)

*   Source: `crawl4ai/async_configs.py`
*   7.1. Purpose: `CrawlerRunConfig` is the primary configuration object passed to `AsyncWebCrawler.arun()` and `AsyncWebCrawler.arun_many()`. It contains various settings that control the behavior of a single crawl run, including those specific to deep crawling.
*   7.2. Relevant Fields:
    *   `deep_crawl_strategy (Optional[DeepCrawlStrategy])`:
        *   Type: `Optional[DeepCrawlStrategy]` (where `DeepCrawlStrategy` is the ABC from `crawl4ai.deep_crawling.base_strategy`)
        *   Default: `None`
        *   Description: Specifies the deep crawling strategy instance (e.g., `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`, `DFSDeepCrawlStrategy`, `BestFirstCrawlingStrategy`) to be used for the crawl. If `None`, deep crawling is disabled, and only the initial URL(s) will be processed.
    *   *Note: Parameters like `max_depth`, `max_pages`, `filter_chain`, `url_scorer`, `score_threshold`, and `include_external` are not direct attributes of `CrawlerRunConfig` for deep crawling. Instead, they are passed to the constructor of the chosen `DeepCrawlStrategy` instance, which is then assigned to `CrawlerRunConfig.deep_crawl_strategy`.*

## 8. Utility Functions

*   **8.1. `normalize_url_for_deep_crawl(url: str, source_url: str) -> str`**
    *   Source: `crawl4ai/deep_crawling/utils.py` (or `crawl4ai/utils.py` if it's a general utility)
    *   8.1.1. Purpose: Normalizes a URL found during deep crawling. This typically involves resolving relative URLs against the `source_url` to create absolute URLs and removing URL fragments (`#fragment`).
    *   8.1.2. Signature: `def normalize_url_for_deep_crawl(url: str, source_url: str) -> str:`
    *   8.1.3. Parameters:
        *   `url (str)`: The URL string to be normalized.
        *   `source_url (str)`: The URL of the page where the `url` was discovered. This is used as the base for resolving relative paths.
    *   8.1.4. Returns: `(str)` - The normalized, absolute URL without fragments.

*   **8.2. `efficient_normalize_url_for_deep_crawl(url: str, source_url: str) -> str`**
    *   Source: `crawl4ai/deep_crawling/utils.py` (or `crawl4ai/utils.py`)
    *   8.2.1. Purpose: Provides a potentially more performant version of URL normalization specifically for deep crawling scenarios, likely employing optimizations to avoid repeated or complex parsing operations. (Note: Based on the provided code, this appears to be the same as `normalize_url_for_deep_crawl` if only one is present, or it might contain specific internal optimizations not exposed differently at the API level but used by strategies).
    *   8.2.2. Signature: `def efficient_normalize_url_for_deep_crawl(url: str, source_url: str) -> str:`
    *   8.2.3. Parameters:
        *   `url (str)`: The URL string to be normalized.

            *   13.4.3.2. Parameters:
                *   `llm_config (Optional[LLMConfig])`: Configuration for the LLM (provider, API key, model, etc.).
                *   `instruction (Optional[str])`: The instruction given to the LLM to guide content filtering (e.g., "Extract only the main article content, excluding headers, footers, and ads.").
                *   `chunk_token_threshold (int)`: Maximum number of tokens per chunk sent to the LLM.
                *   `overlap_rate (float)`: Percentage of overlap between consecutive chunks.
                *   `word_token_rate (float)`: Estimated ratio of words to tokens, used for chunking.
                *   `verbose (bool`, default: `False`)`: Enables verbose logging for LLM operations.
                *   `logger (Optional[AsyncLogger]`, default: `None`)`: Custom logger instance.
                *   `ignore_cache (bool`, default: `True`)`: If `True`, bypasses any LLM response caching for this operation.
        *   13.4.4. Key Implemented Methods:
            *   `filter_content(self, html: str, ignore_cache: bool = True) -> List[str]`:
                *   Description: Chunks the input HTML. For each chunk, it sends a request to the configured LLM with the chunk and the `instruction`. The LLM is expected to return the relevant part of the chunk. These relevant parts are then collected and returned.
