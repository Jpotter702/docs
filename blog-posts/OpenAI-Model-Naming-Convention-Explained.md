# OpenAI Model Naming Explained (2025 Edition)

If you've ever looked at the model switcher in ChatGPT and wondered what the difference is between GPT‑4o, o3, and GPT‑4.5, you're not alone. Here's a quick, plain-English guide.

## 📌 GPT Series

- **GPT‑4o**:  
  “O” stands for *omni* — this is the **multimodal flagship** (text, image, audio). Fast, fluent, and great for most tasks. Released May 2024.

- **GPT‑4.5** *(Research Preview)*:  
  Experimental upgrade between GPT‑4 and GPT‑5. Possibly more fluent and creative than GPT‑4o, but not necessarily better at structured logic.

- **GPT‑4.1**:  
  Under-the-hood upgrade to GPT‑4‑turbo. Text-only, tuned for speed and stability. Likely what powers GPT‑4o’s language engine.

- **GPT‑4.1-mini**:  
  A compact version of 4.1, optimized for quick replies and lower latency.

## 🧠 “o-series” Reasoning Models

These aren’t part of the GPT family. They’re named “o1”, “o3”, “o4”, etc., and are built for **structured reasoning and abstraction**.

- **o3**:  
  Advanced logic model. Best at multi-step planning, goal retention, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Not multimodal.

- **o4-mini**:  
  Successor to o3-mini. Optimized for reasoning with better efficiency.

- **o4-mini-high**:  
  Higher-tier version of o4-mini. Great at coding, visual logic, and consistent goal tracking.

Each model has tradeoffs. For creative generation, GPT‑4o shines. For step-by-step logic and goal planning? Try **o3 or o4-mini-high**.
